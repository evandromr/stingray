def classical_pvalue(power, nspec):
    """
    Compute the probability of detecting the current power under
    the assumption that there is no periodic oscillation in the data.

    This computes the single-trial p-value that the power was
    observed under the null hypothesis that there is no signal in
    the data.

    Important: the underlying assumptions that make this calculation valid
    are:
    (1) the powers in the power spectrum follow a chi-square distribution
    (2) the power spectrum is normalized according to Leahy (1984), such
    that the powers have a mean of 2 and a variance of 4
    (3) there is only white noise in the light curve. That is, there is no
    aperiodic variability that would change the overall shape of the power
    spectrum.

    Also note that the p-value is for a *single trial*, i.e. the power
    currently being tested. If more than one power or more than one power
    spectrum are being tested, the resulting p-value must be corrected for the
    number of trials (Bonferroni correction).

    Mathematical formulation in Groth, 1975.
    Original implementation in IDL by Anna L. Watts.

    Parameters
    ----------
    power :  float
        The squared Fourier amplitude of a spectrum to be evaluated

    nspec : int
        The number of spectra or frequency bins averaged in `power`.
        This matters because averaging spectra or frequency bins increases
        the signal-to-noise ratio, i.e. makes the statistical distributions
        of the noise narrower, such that a smaller power might be very
        significant in averaged spectra even though it would not be in a single
        power spectrum.

    Returns
    -------
    pval : float
        The classical p-value of the observed power being consistent with
        the null hypothesis of white noise

        chi-square distributions with 2M degrees of freedom, where M is the
        number of powers averaged in each bin.

        Note that this function will *only* produce correct results when the
        following underlying assumptions are fulfilled:
        (1) The power spectrum is Leahy-normalized
        (2) There is no source of variability in the data other than the
        periodic signal to be determined with this method. This is important!
        If there are other sources of (aperiodic) variability in the data, this
        method will *not* produce correct results, but instead produce a large
        number of spurious false positive detections!
        (3) There are no significant instrumental effects changing the
        statistical distribution of the powers (e.g. pile-up or dead time)

        By default, the method produces (index,p-values) for all powers in
        the power spectrum, where index is the numerical index of the power in
        question. If a `threshold` is set, then only powers with p-values
        *below* that threshold with their respective indices. If
        `trial_correction` is set to True, then the threshold will be corrected
        for the number of trials (frequencies) in the power spectrum before

        Parameters
        ----------
        threshold : float
            The threshold to be used when reporting p-values of potentially
            significant powers. Must be between 0 and 1.
            Default is 1 (all p-values will be reported).

        trial_correction : bool
            A Boolean flag that sets whether the `threshold` will be correted
            by the number of frequencies before being applied. This decreases
            the threshold (p-values need to be lower to count as significant).
            Default is False (report all powers) though for any application
